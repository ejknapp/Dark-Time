                 is a simple
                clock. It has one simple goal, to allow you to see the time, especially when it's dark. It
                doesn't try to look like a physical clock. It uses a very readable font and color
                scheme to make the time as readable as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#c00;">Dark Time</span> was created from a need to see the time in the
                middle of the night without your iOS device being too bright overall. Some of us
                are light sensitive and the need for a clock that isn't too bright but is highly
                visible has existed for a long time.
